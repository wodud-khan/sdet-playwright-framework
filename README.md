## About the Author

I am a Quality Assurance Engineer with extensive experience spanning manual testing, test automation, and backend validation across business-critical software platforms. My professional background includes supporting web, mobile, API, and data-driven systems in healthcare, retail, and enterprise environments, with a consistent focus on reliability, scalability, and real-world usability.

My expertise covers the full software testing lifecycle, including test planning, functional and regression testing, API validation, database verification, defect lifecycle management, and release readiness support. I have hands-on experience designing and maintaining Python-based automation frameworks using tools such as Pytest, Selenium, and Playwright, as well as integrating automated tests into CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

In addition to traditional QA practices, I have worked extensively with backend systems, validating ETL workflows, business rules, and data integrity using SQL queries, log analysis, and API inspection. I am comfortable collaborating with developers, product owners, and business stakeholders in Agile and hybrid SDLC environments, and I place strong emphasis on clear documentation, reproducibility, and traceability.

I also bring experience in modern, AI-assisted and cloud-adjacent systems, including workflow automation, low-code platforms, and large-language-model–enabled solutions. This background has strengthened my ability to think beyond test execution and focus on system behavior, risk identification, and long-term maintainability.

This repository is maintained as a professional portfolio to demonstrate my approach to quality engineering, automation design, and practical problem-solving. It reflects how I structure test code, document assumptions, and apply industry best practices to deliver dependable, production-ready software.
